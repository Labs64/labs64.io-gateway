# Labs64.IO :: API Gateway
## Unified API Gateway for Labs64.IO Microservices

![Docker Image Version](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/labs64/api-gateway?logo=docker&logoColor=%23E14817&color=%23E14817)

Key responsibilities of the API Gateway:

- Request Routing: Directs incoming HTTP/S requests to the appropriate backend service or RabbitMQ exchange/queue.
- Protocol Translation: Translates synchronous HTTP/S requests from clients into asynchronous messages for RabbitMQ, and vice-versa for responses.
- Authentication and Authorization: Enforces security policies before requests reach your internal services.
- Rate Limiting and Throttling: Protects your backend from abuse and ensures fair usage.
- Caching: Caches responses for frequently accessed data, reducing load on your backend.
- Request/Response Transformation: Modifies request or response bodies/headers to fit external API contracts.
- Load Balancing: Distributes requests across multiple instances of your services.
- Monitoring and Logging: Provides a central point for tracking API usage and performance.
